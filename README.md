## (1/3/24) Changes:
arb_optimizer.py is done for now. 
- May be necessary is converting it into a script that accepts arguments for odds rather than user input
- May be necessary to alter how it prints the odds as well
Going to work on scraping from betting sites next. After that, we set up DB to put them in.



## Arb Betting Notes / Ideas

- VPN or spoof IP to avoid sports book IP ban
- use AWS to host scripts and dbs

Steps:
1. Run script on time interval to scrape lines
2. 

Found someone elses API for this, pretty sure API key costs money tho
